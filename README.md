> mirror-api.php

This file provides a mirror from the acs.leagueoflegends.com site output to your own website, this is because Riot's website does not allow the JQuery function of $.getJSON. Mirroring it to your own website is a workaround for this.

Requirements:

- PHP

The output generated by `mirror-api.php` will be the following:


    Used url:
    http://www.scias.net/riotapi/mirror-api.php?r=na&n=DJScias
    (R = Region, N = Name)

    Returns:
	{
	    "platformId":"NA",
	    "accountId":300554
	}

`platformId`defines the region's name where this account is located, it is not always the same as inputted in the URL as regions can also be NA1, EUW1, etc.. in Match Histories.

`accountId` defines the account ID tied to this player name, this is needed as the League of Legends Match History operates on account IDs and not on summoner IDs.

Together this will result to:
`http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA/300554`
Both NA were used (platformId) and 300554 (accountId) from the mirror-api to create this successful link.

> php-riot-api.php

This file provides a more in-depth stats generated through the usage of a region and summoner name, the actual Riot API is needed together with an [Developer API Key](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and the dependencies also found in [Kevin Ohashi's Project](https://github.com/kevinohashi/php-riot-api). The dependencies are NOT included in this repository, please follow the before-mentioned link to gain them.

Requirements:

- PHP
- [php-riot-api](https://github.com/kevinohashi/php-riot-api) by Kevin Ohashi (dependencies)

The output generated by `php-riot-api.php` will be the following:


    Used url:
    http://www.scias.net/riotapi/php-riot-api.php?r=NA&n=DJScias
    (R = Region, N = Name)

    Returns:
    {
	    "273719":
	    {
		   "id":273719,
		   "name":"DJScias",
		   "profileIconId":550,
		   "summonerLevel":30,
		   "revisionDate":1409411323000
		}
	}

`id`defines the summoner's ID associated with this summoner name, this can be used for a variety of other reasons within the Riot API.

`name` this is the summoner's name, pretty self-explanatory.

`profileIconID` this is the ID of the current profile icon this summoner uses, this is a way to generate profile icons by filling them in through this link: [DJScias' Current Profile Icon](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/4.19.2/img/profileicon/550.png). Pay attention to the URL, especially the last part before .png.

`summonerLevel` defines the current summoner's level, can be used for output.

`revisionData`defines an UNIX date which represents the last time this information was updated, this seems to be the last time you have logged into your account. To make this timestamp readable to humans, use the following link: [UNIX Timestamp Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com/).
